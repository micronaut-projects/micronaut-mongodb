This project includes integration between Micronaut and MongoDB.

Note that this project provides only low-level access to the MongoDB client drivers (both synchronous and reactive). If you are looking for a more complete experience including support for data access repositories see the documentation for https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#mongo[Micronaut Data MongoDB] as well as these useful guides:
